# Rubik's Cube Solver

The Rubik's cube solver uses this algorithm https://hobbylark.com/puzzles/Rubik-Cube-Algorithms which seems simple but as it requires seeing all the colors identifying the pattern and thinking of the right move, its very mind boggling to program.

  - A simple standard Rubik's cube solver
  - Built around object-oriented design
  - its in 3D

# New Features!

  - Rather than just a randomizer button, now you can jumble it using the given controls
  - Change the animation speed while you solve/jumble.




### Tech

Dillinger uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [Python] - Programming language that lets you work quickly
and integrate systems more effectively.
* [Python visual module] - Awesome 3D graphics lib which uses openGl under the hood, you can use visual python setup which contains both, the module and python setup 



### Installation

Download visual module to install along with your python setup or download [VPython] which contains both. an then run the cub.py script using the python editor
or
```sh
$ python path-to-cube.py  //make sure this python setup containg python-visual module or you should be using vpython which comes bundled with these modules
```
