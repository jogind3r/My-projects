Hi there,
	this is a 3d Rubik's cube for learning purpose.

how to install?

1. install python-2.7 and Vpython-win-py-2.7 from http://vpython.org/
2. double click the cube.py to run.

3. if idle or vidle editor opens instead of running the program then press f5 to
	run it through the idle editor.
